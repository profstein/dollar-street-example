## Description
The family lives in South Africa. M is 41 years old and he works as a porter at a hospital. His wife L is 39 years old and she is a guest house supervisor. They live with their daughter Y, 11 years old, and son O, 4 years old. M and L collectively work for 84 hours per week. Additionally, L also spends 20 hours per week doing part-time work. The family lives in a 2-bedroom house and have been living here for 2 years. They own the house and like its safety, however, they dislike its hot and noisy environment. The house has uninterrupted electricity, indoor toilets, and in-house drinking water supply. It was acquired through a Government housing subsidy and is located in an area closer to their workplace. The family purchases all their food supplies from the market and it costs them 60% of their income. They use natural gas for cooking in the kitchen. Drinking water is available inside their home and is safe to consume. The family is not saving money. They sometimes go on vacation and have been to Transkei, southeastern region of South Africa on their farthest trip. The next thing they plan on buying is a new wardrobe for clothes. Their dream is to build their yard area and raise a proper garden.
