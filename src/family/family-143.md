## Description
The family lives in Tunisia. R is 36 years old and works as a mason. His wife S is also 36 years old and is a housewife. They live with their 2 sons; H, 6 years old, and Z, 4 years old. D works for a total of 60 hours/week. The family lives in a rented one-bedroom house. They’ve been living there for the past 5 years. The house has electricity, which fails several times a week, running water, and toilet facility. The family has to buy all their food supplies, which cost them about 30% of their income. They use natural gas for cooking in the kitchen and also spend up to 10% of their income on buying drinking water. The family hardly saves any money since most of it is spent on food and rent. They’ve never been on vacation and the furthest they have ever been was Gasrene, Tunisia. The next big thing they plan to buy is a fridge. They hope that one day they will be able to fulfill their dream of buying a farmland.
