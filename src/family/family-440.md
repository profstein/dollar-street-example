## Description

The family lives in Philippines. L is 40 years old and is a small scale farmer who also sometimes works as a lumberjack. His wife M is 36 years old and they live with their 3 sons G, 12 years old, and C, 9 years old, who both are students, and J, 5 months old. L works for a total of 48 hours/week. He sometimes gets an additional 20 hours working as a lumberjack. The family lives in a 2-bedroom house, which they own and got built with the help of family and friends. They've been living there for the past 40 years. The house has electricity, which fails several times a week, and toilet facility. The family buys 50% of their food and produces the rest 50% themselves. They use electricity and wood for cooking in the kitchen. Leo and the children spend 2 hours a week collecting water that is safe to drink, which takes 10 minutes to collect and come back. The whole family spends 7 hours a week collecting wood. The parents spend 21 hours a week attending to home agricultural activities and M spends an extra 21 hours a week doing housework. The family saves money and sometimes go on vacation. The furthest they have ever been was Manila, in the Philippines. The next big thing they plan to spend money on is constructing a new roof for the house. They hope that one day they will be able to fulfill their dream of buying a big house.
