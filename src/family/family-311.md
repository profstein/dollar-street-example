## Description

The family lives in Serbia. They are 2 adult and 2 children family members. D is 35 years old and he is a freelance photographer. His wife M is 34 years old and she is a clothes designer. They live along with their two daughters, P, 4 years old, and V, 3 years old. The family lives in a 2-bedroom house which they own. They moved from their small city apartment to this house and have been living here for 1.5 years. They like its size, location, space, and backyard, however, they dislike its surroundings. The house has running water, indoors toilet facility, and electricity, which fails for an hour once a week. The family purchases 95% of their food supplies from the market and the rest comes from their own production. They use natural gas to cook their food in the kitchen, and safe drinking water is also available at their home. The family goes on vacations and have been to Athens, Greece on one of their farthest trip. Their next big plan is to buy more photo equipment. They dream of one day being able to buy a lake or a mountain house.
